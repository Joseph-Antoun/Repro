This repository contains a working version of the code available at
https://github.com/gbernstein6/private_bayesian_regression

For the code to run, we had to make some minor modifications to 
./mcmc.py
./generate_data.py

They can be traced by searching for the comment "# Project4 Modified"

These modifications are detailed in section III-B of the write-up.

The code runs with
>>> python driver.py
